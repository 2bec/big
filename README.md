This is a ridiculous presentation system that works great for
creative, hurried people.

It makes text and images as big as they can be, gives you minimal
styling (`em`), and gives you left/right arrows for navigation.

Use it by throwing the HTML chunk at the top of pages, and then
divs for slides.

See [the demo](http://macwright.org/big) for an example of it working,
and [the source for the demo for an example of how to make it work](https://github.com/tmcw/big/blob/gh-pages/index.html).
