This is a ridiculous presentation system that works great for
creative, hurried people.

It makes text and images as big as they can be, gives you minimal
styling (`em`), and gives you left/right arrows for navigation.

Use it by throwing the HTML chunk at the top of pages, and then
divs for slides.

See [the demo](http://macwright.org/big) for an example of it working.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title></title><link href='big.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /><script src='big.js'></script></head><body>
<div>Big</div>
<div><em>Presentation software</em> for busy busy hackers</div>
<div>text</div>
<div>as <em>big</em> as it can be</div>
<div>no config</div>
<div><em>4k</em></div>
<div><em>images too</em></div>
<div><img src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/5757000880_509440308e_z.jpg' /></div>
<div>JS+CSS <a href='https://github.com/tmcw/big'>github.com/ tmcw/ big</a></div>
```
